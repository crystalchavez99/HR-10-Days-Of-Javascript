# Objective
In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the let and const keywords. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task
1. Declare a constant variable,*PI*, and assign it the value `Math.PI`. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
2. Read a number,*r*, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
3. Use *PI* and *r* to calculate the and of a circle having radius *r*.
4. Print *area* as the first line of output and print *perimeter* as the second line of output.

**NOTE**

I was unable to do a test spec for this problem unfortunately.

### Output Format
Print the following two lines:
1. On the first line, print the *area* of the circle having radius *r*.
2. On the second line, print the *perimeter* of the circle having radius *r*.
