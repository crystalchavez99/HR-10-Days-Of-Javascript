# Objective

Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task

Variables named *firstInteger*, *firstString*, and *firstDecimal*, are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the `+` operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Convert *secondInteger* to an integer (Number type), then sum it with firstInteger
and print the result on a new line using `console.log`.
2. Convert *secondDecimal* to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with *firstDecimal* and print the result on a new line using `console.log`.
3. Print the concatenation of *firstString* and *secondString* on a new line using `console.log`. Note that *firstString* must be printed first.

### Output Format

Print the following three lines of output:

1. On the first line, print the sum of *firstInteger* and the integer representation of *secondInteger*.
2. On the second line, print the sum of *firstDecimal* and the floating-point representation of *secondDecimal*.
3. On the third line, print *firstString* concatenated with *secondString*. You must print *firstString* before *secondString*.
